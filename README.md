## 📃 Summary

> I love developing web sites that are beautiful, but also fluid, responsive, and easy to use. I focus on UX/UI design with an extensive knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS, React, Svelte, SEO, and logo design. I have a background in Graphic Design and building out design systems with the Atomic Design methodology. I thrive in the front of the frontend and stitching together the Jamstack. I have recently been working with Next.JS and SvelteKit.
